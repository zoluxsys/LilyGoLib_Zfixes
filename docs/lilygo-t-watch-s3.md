## `1` Overview

* This page introduces how to use the `LilyGO T-Watch-S3`
* As of 2025/04/28, platformio does not support the latest esp-arduino v3 and above. The current supported version is v2.0.17 (based on IDF v4.4.7) , If you need to use platformio for development, please jump [LilyGoLib-PlatformIO](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib-PlatformIO)

## `2` Arduino IDE Quick Start

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Install [Arduino ESP32 **V3.3.0-alpha1** or later or latest](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
  * Tips : Arduino manager URL: https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json
3. [Download LilyGoLib Library](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
4. Open `Arduino IDE` -> `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Add .ZIP Library` -> `Select the library compressed package downloaded in step 3`
5. [Install LilyGoLib-ThirdParty](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib-ThirdParty)
    * Copy all directories in [LilyGoLib-ThirdParty](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib-ThirdParty) to ArduinoIDE libraries directory, if there is no `libraries` directory, please create it.
    * Please note that instead of copying the `LilyGoLib-ThirdParty` directory, copy the folders in the `LilyGoLib-ThirdParty` directory to libraries
    * How to find the location of your own libraries on your computer, [please see here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer)
        * Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\Arduino`
        * macOS: `/Users/{username}/Documents/Arduino`
        * Linux: `/home/{username}/Arduino`

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the libraries in LilyGoLib-ThirdParty are not necessarily the latest versions. Please do not upgrade the versions of the dependent libraries before confirming that the hardware is running normally.
ArduinoIDE will prompt that there is a new version of the library to upgrade every time it is opened.
Please confirm that it is running normally before trying to update to the latest version. If you encounter problems, please roll back to the version of the dependent library that runs normally. The current list of dependent library versions can be viewed [here](./third_party.md#t-watch-s3-third-party)

9. Select `Port`
10. Click `upload` , Wait for compilation and writing to complete
11. If you cannot upload sketch or the USB device keeps popping up on the computer, please manually put the device into download mode. How to enter download mode, please see the [here](#t-watch-s3-enter-download-mode).

> \[!TIP]
>
> * If there is no message output from the serial port, please check whether USB CDC ON Boot is set to Enabled.
> * Board Revision changes according to the actual RF module model. The current default version is SX1262
> * This library depends on the latest [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/tag/3.3.0-alpha1) version. If it is lower than **V3.3.0-alpha1**, an error will be reported.

### T-Watch-S3 Enter Download Mode

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> 🤖 USB ports keep popping in and out?
> If you have installed a third-party firmware such as meshtastic, please be sure to follow these steps to update the firmware, regardless of whether it is meshtastic or lilygo factory firmware.
>
> Download mode is only required when the program is not allowed to upload the sketch. This step is not required under normal circumstances.
>
> Follow the steps below to put your device into download mode
>
> 1. Remove the back of the watch and extract the battery. Be careful not to pull off the soldered battery wires
> 2. Insert the Micro-USB cable into the T-Watch-S3
> 3. Open the Windows Device Manager and check the Ports column
> 4. Long press the crown until the port disappears from the list
> 5. Press and hold the **BOOT** button in the red box below
> 6. Press the crown for one second. The device port number should be visible in the computer device manager
> 7. Release the **BOOT** button
> 8. The watch is now in download mode and you can upload your program
> 9. After the upload is complete, you need to long press the crown to shut down the watch, and then restart it again. At this time, the device exits download mode
>
> If the new code is successfully written, but the device does not light up or has other problems, please use our factory test code to test whether the peripherals can work properly. Please jump here to download the firmware and write it for testing.
